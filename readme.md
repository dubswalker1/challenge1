# Sender/Receiver

This is a simple python code project using asyncio to generate and send data from a "sender" server to a "receiver" server.

## Installation

Pull down this repo from github, then create the environment (ex. using venv):

```bash
git origin
py -m venv env
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## Usage
Start the sender server (in one console):
```bash
python sender.py
```
Once started, the sender server will await a connection.  Once connection is made (by the receiver), it will begin generating the sequence of binary output files and sending them to the connector.

Start the receiver server (in another console):
```bash
python receiver.py
```
Once started, the receiver should quickly begin receiving data from the sender.  This will continue until 100 files have been generated by the sender and sent to the receiver.  Once the final file is received, both the sender and receiver stdout should both display matching totals for data sent and received on each end.
Note:  if started prior to the sender server, the receiver will continue to connect to the sender, until it becomes available.  The connection retries will be displayed in stdout, until the maximum retries of 10 is reached.  At that point, the receiver will no longer attempt to connect and it will be necessary to restart (ctrl-C) the receiver to initiate the data transfer operation with the sender server.

To run the included pytest tests:
```bash
pytest
```
Note:  2/3 tests will fail if the sender and receiver servers have not been started before running pytest.  Also, it is recommended that execution of pytest be performed after the sender server has completed sending to the receiver\
and "waiting for something to send" is displayed in the console output.
